# Hooks 

Hooks within React are built in methods that add functionality to your web page
Hooks are generally asychnronous and use the underlying or background processes of React to complete goals

Hooks were introduced in React version 16 (maybe..) over a year ago now to make functional creation simpler 


React used to be primarily completed with class based components 

const Home extends Component {
    render(
        <h2> Header </h2>
    )
}

Hooks allow us to access the component functionality while using JavaScript functional language 

useState() <--  Hook that allows us to access the state functionality of React 
useEffect() <-- Hook that specifies what we want the app to do when the page is rendered
